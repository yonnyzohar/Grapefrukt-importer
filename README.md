Grapefrukt-importer
===================

The Grapefrukt exporter is the best software i've come accross in exporting animations for mobile projects.
found here:
https://github.com/grapefrukt/grapefrukt-export

once the project is exported to images and xml files, 
use this importer to bring them back for use.

Inside Main you'll find an AnimationNode and
AnimationNodeMatrix class - select the relevant one according to how you
exported your animation with the grapefrukt tool. you'll find examples
in the lib folder
